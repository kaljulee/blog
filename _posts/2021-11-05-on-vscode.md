title: Note on the change to VSCode
---

Switching from WebStorm to VSCode was for a couple of reasons-

<ul>
    <li>I haven't paid for WebStorm in a while, and have been wondering if the missing updates mean I'm missing out</li>
    <li>A couple of friends are considering starting to code, and I'd like to recommend an IDE that is both free and what I'm currently using</li>
    <li>I have a vague sense that I should try mixing things up</li>
</ul>

My first impression was that I liked the window layout; it's easier for me to navigate a million open tabs.
My second impression was that the Git controls just aren't as good. This might be because I'm used to WebStorm and VSCode is new, but I don't know. I don't remember WebStorm needing additional extensions added and configured. Even with the extensions, I don't find the Git flow to be as nice.

But! Today I was finally able to make my linting do what I want: trailing commas _and_ single-quotes in JSX. I guess I'll stick with VSCode a little longer.
