Getting github connected was harder than I expected. I only pull, push, fetch, merge, and sometimes rebase. And half of that happens through WebStorm GUIs. Part of the difficulty may be in having switched to VS Code. I've been thinking about trying a new IDE, and now seemed as good a time as any.  
I am getting an error when going command line in this project. Github command line is working fine in Nice Train, so I powered through using the VS Code github GUI. Does that count as giving up? Perhaps! But also I can more on to more interesting work.
